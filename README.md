Using simple trigenometry, a triangle can be constructed with the two cameras and the laser point as its verticies.  The distance to the laser point can then be determined from the median of the triangle.
To determine the inner angles of the triangle:

$$ \frac{tan(theta_1)}{tan(theta_0)} = \frac{l}{l_0} $$
